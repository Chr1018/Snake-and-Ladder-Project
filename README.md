# Snake-and-Ladder-Project
<b>This is a console Snake and ladder project .Its made with Java.
As you must know how to play a simple  Snake and ladder Board game this is a console java project implementing the same.</b>

This project has 2 packages named as:

	1. snake_ladder having classes: dice,Player and SLgame.
	2. student_details having a class: Student and an interface: checkstring.

I have used Math.random for getting a random number from 1 to 6 in the dice class.

In Player class I have made simple functions to get the Players current position. Also with the help of switch case to determine positions of snakes and ladders.
Basically Player Class has all the important functions related to incrementing/decrementing and updating player position and checking if a player reaches 100th position.

In SLgame class I have displayed the basic instructions and details. Also i am reading the Player names here and checking if its valid with the help of isstring() 
function present in this class.
This is the class having the main function and objects are created accordingly.

In Student Class I have added my basic Student details. 
There is an interface named checkstring which has been implemented in SLgame.

The above project has these OOP concepts covered:

	1.Scope and Lifetime of variables.
	2.Declaring objects.
	3.Instance Variables of different data types.
	4.Constructors/Methods.
	5.'this' keyword.
	6.Inheritance.
	7.Overloading (Constructors/Methods)
	8.Overriding.
	9.Objects as parameters.
	10.Access control mechanism.
	11.Use of 'super'.
	12.Packages.
	13.Interfaces.
	14.Exception Handling.
	15.Creation of thread to execute a certain process.
